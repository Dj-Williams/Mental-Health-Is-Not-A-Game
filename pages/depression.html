        <div class="depressSlideBox1"><h3>What is Depression?</h3>
            
            <p>Depression is described as a mental state of persistent low-self worth/value/esteem, and is often paired with an extreme difficulty to enjoy the things in life that previously brought fufillment. Depression is different from general sadness or grieving the loss of a loved one, because the latter two are defined and clear causes as to why one would be in a mentally down state. Depression has a myriad of causes, which can vary from the biochemical to the psychosocial, and is generally marked with disproportionate melancholic responses in both the duration and intensity of the emotion.</p> </div>
